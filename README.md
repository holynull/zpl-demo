# zpl-demo Desctiption

Use Openzeppelin framework develop Etheruem contracts. Use Truffle to compile and test.

# Notice

We build a node project for the contract development. But some plugins and dependencies may have problems with the last node.

My suggestion is that use the node with the version 10. So install a `nvm` manage your node version for convenient.


# Install


```
npm install
```
